# GUI based Dating App: Fuel!

A desktop application written in Python using tkinter. This application is a simple dating platform where users can create a profile, login, see the list of other users on the platform, propose them and if lucky can find a match. It uses a MySQL database to store and manage user information. I have used MySQL connector for python v3.7 to facilitate running SQL queries and Xampp to run a local web server.

The home window looks like:

Upon successful login users will be directed to the main menu:

The list of users can be viewed as:

You can propose any user you desire:

The list of users you have proposed can be viewed separately:

Users can even take a look at proposals they have received:

Finally if you are lucky enough, you will get a match:

I have only tried it using local server but it can be easily used with a cloud server. 
Feel free to suggest changes or new features.
